A mini weather app created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html), and the [Weatherbit rapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/weatherbit/api/weather/endpoints).



## Getting started
🌦️ Clone repo in teminal: `git clone https://github.com/dani-boo/weather-app.git`  
🌦️ Change directory with `cd weather-app`  
🌦️ Run `yarn` to install dependencies

## NB: You need an API key from weatherbit - [subscribe here.](https://rapidapi.com/weatherbit/api/weather/endpoints)
Once you've generated that, you'll need to create a `.env` folder in the root of the project, and add your API key like so:
`REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=${insert-your-shiny-new-key-here}`


**`yarn start`**

runs the "app" in dev mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


**`yarn test`**

launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.<br />
Try `yarn test --coverage` to see 100% coverage - this will also generate a coverage report in the project's root directory: `coverage/lcov-report`
(*reveal in finder to open coverage index.html files)
